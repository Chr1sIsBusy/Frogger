# Frogger Clone

### Short desc./Rules
A basic clone of frogger, you must move the green square/frog to the red square/goal all the while dodging obstacles such as cars and rushing water.There is also a timer and a pause button. It was a good way for me to learn more about html and Javascript and how they can interact with each other. 

### To use 

1. Go into Frogger folder and run index.html.
2. Use arrow keys to move.
